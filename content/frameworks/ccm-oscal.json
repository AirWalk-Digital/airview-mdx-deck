All security requirement aspects should be considered from functional, physical, and business requirements perspectives. In addition, security requirements should derive from security objectives and/or organizational goals and regulatory requirements. Industry standards should be applied at project inception and every stage of the SSDLC process—including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and end-of-life (EoL) processes.\n\nTo successfully enable SSDLC security, roles and expectations should be clearly defined and published, and an inventory of applications and their metadata should exist in an easily accessible format.\n\nAppropriate security practice examples for the common stages of an SSDLC are provided below to include the following categories: training, requirements, design, development, testing, and release and response.\n\n1. Training:\n2. Role-based secure development training should be required at multiple stages of employment (or other contractual relationships), including on-boarding and role changes.\n3. Refresher training should be delivered throughout one's career, regardless of position or movement in their organization.\n4. Targeted, specialty training should be created and made available as the organization adopts new technologies.\n5. Progressively advanced training should be made available to relevant employees (and contractors whenever applicable) as they transition through technical roles and/or champion program participants.\n\n1. Requirements:\n2. Generic and specialized security requirements should be defined, published, organized, and easily accessible to all organizational roles.\n3. Every application, during each iteration, should review existing requirements and research if additional requirements are necessary. It is beneficial for the engineering teams to consult with a security professional at this time.\n\n1. Design:\n2. Security-focused design reviews are conducted.\n3. Threat models are developed or modified.\n4. The design of new or enhanced security controls, required by the application design, is developed.\n\n1. Development:\n2. Develop, as per design specifications.\n3. Abuse cases are used to develop a security-focused unit and integration tests during development.\n4. Secure coding practices are implemented and enforced through automation and manual peer code reviews.\n\n1. Security Testing:\n2. Manual and automated test plans are developed and executed with abuse cases in mind.\n3. Automation may include one or more of SCA, SAST, DAST, IAST, fuzzing, credential scans, etc.\n4. Penetration testing may be executed during this stage, based on need.\n5. Crowdsourced testing or private bug bounty programs may be implemented.\n\n1. Release:\n2. Change control is instituted, including gating and documenting releases to ensure requirements and compliance objectives are met.\n\n1. Response:\n2. Monitoring and alerting are in place to identify security issues and enable response activities.\n3. A response plan exists and can be easily executed when a security issue is discovered.\n4. A process is established for monitoring external sources for vulnerability disclosures and responding when applicable.\n"

Criteria should be developed for use when assessing the automation required by an application, as not all systems will benefit equally.\n\nStrategy:\n\n1. Identify the goals and requirements of the automation implementation.\n\nExample goals:\n\n- Security requirements are not relaxed to improve speed.\n- All developers can leverage tools to detect security weaknesses while developing software.\n- All third-party libraries are scanned for known vulnerabilities.\n- All authentication and authorization functions “pass” abuse case unit tests before deployment.\n- All website security headers are verified to meet security requirements when deployed.\n\nExample requirements:\n\n- Applicable programming languages should be supported by static analysis tools.\n- Python and C# should be supported by select static analysis tools.\n- Automation should not require infrastructure support.\n- All automation tools should offer an application programming interface (API).\n- All website security headers are verified to meet security requirements when deployed.\n\nStrategy can also include, but is not limited to:\n\n1. Security testing for unintentional side effects and behaviors that are not specified in the test plan or design.\n2. Security testing for incident response procedures, such as simulating breaches.\n3. Determining which portfolio applications warrant investment in automation. Prioritize the adoption order based on criticality.\n\nConsiderations:\n\n1. Security requirements\n2. Risk, business, and compliance requirements\n3. Development methodology\n4. Lifecycle\n5. Metrics establishment\n\nExample:\n\n- Count or percentage of (test type) adoption among applications requiring (test type) SAST, DAST, SCA, etc.\n- Count or percentage of false positives produced by test automation.\n- Count or percentage of execution-time SLA breaches by test automation.\n- Soft measures, including satisfaction levels with usability.\n- Change in the number of security weaknesses discovered after release.\n- Percentage coverage of automated test cases for exposed APIs and SDK functions by service (i.e., the total number of automated test cases for APIs/SDK functions; the total number of APIs/SDK by service).\n- Evaluate test types to determine which is best suited for different categories of applications based on the attributes of those in the prioritized inventory.\n\nConsiderations:\n\n- Development and security team sizes\n- Platform and operating systems\n- Maturity of build automation\n- Language support\n\nExecution:\n\n1. Avoid approaches that cause unreasonable delays to builds and deployments or require significant process modification or resource commitment from development teams.\n2. Seek to adopt automation at multiple SDLC integration points\n\nExample integration points:\n\n1. A plugin in the developer's integrated development environment (IDE).\n2. Abuse case unit and integration tests—created and maintained by developers—and executed during development and build cycles.\n3. Static application security testing or SCA scans executed during automated builds.\n4. Dynamic application security testing scans executed during automated deployment.\n\n1. Automate patching when possible.\n2. Use metrics to drive feedback loops and continuous improvement.\n\n1. Maintain an accurate count of license utilization.\n2. Tune automation to reduce false positives and false negatives.\n3. Analyze gaps in support and trends for response and planning.\n\n1.

Data at rest involves databases, end-user workstations, and file servers.\n3. Data in transit involves system interfaces, public networks, and electronic messaging.\n4. Cryptography provides data protection: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and source authentication.\n5. Cryptographic key management system security policies rules need to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and source authentication of all keys, algorithms, and metadata.\n6. Key management technology and processes should be NIST FIPS validated and/or National Security Agency (NSA)-approved by other relevant international standardization bodies.\n7.

Guidance on selecting strong authentication credentials.\n2. Guidance for how users should protect their authentication credentials.\n3. Generic user IDs are disabled or removed.\n4.

In addition, agreements should include requirements to address the information security risks associated with information and communications technology services (e.g., cloud computing services) and the product supply chain. These requirements are subsequently applicable to relevant, third-party (i.e., fourth parties)  subcontractors (and so on) throughout the supply chain.\n\nPersonnel security requirements should be established and documented—including security roles and responsibilities for third-party providers coordinated and aligned with internal security roles and responsibilities. Monitor providers for compliance.\n\nAdditionally, the organization should have a screening process for contractors and third-party users. When organizations provide contractors, the contract should specify the organization's responsibilities for screening and relevant notification procedures if screening has not been completed (or if the results cause doubts or concerns). Similarly, third-party agreements should specify all responsibilities and notification procedures for screening.\n\nThird-party providers should notify a designated individual or role (e.g., a member of the contracting or supply chain function) of any personnel transfers or terminations of third-party personnel who possess organizational credentials, badges, or have information system privileges.\n\nFormal contracts should be employed that, at a minimum, specify:\n\n1. The covered information’s confidential nature and value.\n2. The security measures to be implemented and/or complied with. These include the organization's information security requirements and appropriate controls required by applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards and guidance, and third-party access limitations.\n3. The service levels to be achieved in the services provided.\n4. The format and frequency of reporting to the organization's information security management forum.\n5. The arrangement for representation of the third party in appropriate organizational meetings and working groups.\n6. The arrangements for third-party compliance auditing.\n7. The penalties exacted if any of the preceding specifications fail.\n\nMutually agreed-upon provisions and/or terms should be established to satisfy customer (tenant) requirements for service-to-service application (API), information processing interoperability, portability for application development and information exchange, usage, and integrity persistence.\n"
